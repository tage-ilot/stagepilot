# Lighting and Lightkey MIDI output

StagePilot's **Lighting** connection sends short MIDI Note On/Note Off pulses to a
lighting application. Lightkey is the initial supported and tested target, but
the transport uses standard MIDI messages rather than a Lightkey-only API.

## Two-Mac routing

For the production layout described here:

- StagePilot runs on the iMac.
- Lightkey runs on the MacBook.
- Both Macs are connected to the same reliable wired production network.

On the MacBook, open **Audio MIDI Setup**, show MIDI Studio, open **MIDI Network
Setup**, and create and enable a session. Allow the iMac to connect. On the
iMac, open its MIDI Network Setup and connect to the MacBook session. The
connected session should then appear in StagePilot's **Lighting** output list.

In Lightkey, open **Settings → External Control** and select the network session
under Input. Add a MIDI trigger to a cue, then use **Send test cue** in StagePilot
to let Lightkey learn the selected note. StagePilot intentionally offers MIDI
channels 1–15 because Lightkey recommends avoiding channel 16 for this trigger
workflow.

## Song timelines

Choose a loaded song in **Lighting configuration** and add cue rows. Each row
contains:

- elapsed `mm:ss` from the confirmed song/timer start;
- MIDI note;
- Note On velocity;
- an optional operator label.

StagePilot starts the timeline only after ProPresenter reports that its timer
start sequence succeeded. Stopping or restarting the timer cancels all remaining
cues from the old timeline. A restart creates one fresh timeline at elapsed
`00:00`. Cues beyond the confirmed song duration are not scheduled.

The large dashboard clock counts down the scheduled remaining time. The smaller
clock counts elapsed time up from the same start timestamp.

## Why MIDI Clock is not used for `mm:ss`

Playback MIDI Clock carries musical tempo pulses while tracks are playing. It
does not provide an absolute song timestamp, so counting its pulses would be
more complex and less reliable for a seconds-based timeline. StagePilot uses a
local monotonic clock for `mm:ss` cues. MIDI Clock can be added later as a
separate optional input for beat- or bar-based lighting effects without changing
the seconds-based scheduler.
